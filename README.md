# Predict_Churn-for-a-Telecom-company-using-Logistic-Regression
This is my first full project for classification problem 

 In this project we got data for 51 states for customers using the telecommunication company and we found the 15% of our customer are leaving the compnay, so we tried to find wich factor effects on this phenomenon.
 We found that the charges varabile give the same effect on the results and have high correlation and this thing we can applied it on number of minutes they spend.
 
 In This project we deal with objective, float, and integer data type, we used two moedels and compared between both of them LogisticRegression and GradientBoostingClassifier.
Also we used different type of metrics to check our models area under the curve, precision curve and others.
